          >Here is a perfect example of the clownworld. Watch as a Canadian MP
          asks a dozen of our "elected officials" (including the finance
          minister) where the 7 BILLION dollars is coming from needed to pay for
          the newest round of insane COVID spending. No one seems to have an
          answer!</p2

          Nicholls mention a massive increase in still births by women who've
          taken the fauxine. This is being directly reported by doctors in his
          riding. For daring to queston the fauxine he is heckled by his peers.
          We then get the amazing CLOWNWORLD response from a perfect example of
          a Clown the Ontario Minister of Health Christine Elliott. "The fauxine
          is safe (LIES -- it's not) and effective (MORE LIES -- it's not) and pregnant women should take this dangerous experimental gene
          therapy!" (said no one ever...except apperently this clown.)</p2

          Wonder how much this prick is getting paid by Pfizer. Hopefully it's
